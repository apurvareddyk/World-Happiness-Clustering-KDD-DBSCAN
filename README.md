# World-Happiness-Clustering-KDD-DBSCAN
This project uses the KDD process to analyze the World Happiness Report dataset. By applying the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, it identifies clusters of countries based on happiness indicators and detects outliers. The project follows all KDD steps and visualizes the results using PCA for better interpretability.
